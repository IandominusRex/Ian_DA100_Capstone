# Ian_DA100_Capstone
## This is my final capstone project for the course DA100: Data Analytics with SQL and Tableau by [Heicoders Academy]([url](https://heicodersacademy.com/about-us/)) 
The objective of the Capstone was to identify consumer spending patterns using GoCard (method of payment) in different regions, through different products, and for different expenses. This will allow us to improve our marketing efforts in the towns lacking in GoCard usership, improving overall usage across Singapore Island.

##Technical Skills Applied
- SQL Data Extraction and Manipulation from database
- Tableau Data Visualisation
- Data Analysis and Interpretation

##Capstone Output
From this Capstone project, I extracted data from a local database using SQL and connected the SQL database to a Tableau Server. I understood the requirements of the project and its intended target audience (Product & Marketing Teams), catering my visualization dashboard to the needs of the respective teams. The outcome was a clean, organized, interactive dashboard with appropriate filters and information for the teams to conveniently utilize and interpret my findings.
